# Seguridad Spring

This is a project that I create following the tutorial on youtube [Curso Spring][def] to learn Spring.
In this project I implement the spring security the basic login. Here I use Maven to handle dependencies.
Also create a custom login using boostrap framework, implement logout and identify the roles. 
Limit access to certain pages based on the role. Create custom error pages. Hidden resources based on roles.
Set dependencies to connect with database (MySQL) and handle the pool connections, create properties file for jdbc driver 
and connection pool, and specify it in the configuration of Spring.
